# How Computers Work with Bill Gates

## Just Bill Gates being a nerd and being a boss about it.

# How Computers Work: What makes a computer, a computer?

- Computers are everywhere
- Throughout history we use tools to help with tasks

### - 4 things common to all computers

    - Input
    - Storage
    - Processing
    - Output

- Computers started off as metal machines to calculators and now electrical machines
- Input
    - Stuff you do that tells the computer to do stuff
- Storage
    - Input is stored in the computer where its saved
- Processing
    - Runs through a series of commands (Algorithms)
- Output
    - Stuff we see or the result that computers pukes out

# How Computers Work: Binary Data

- Nobody work with ones and zeros
- Wires and circuits that carry all information in the computer
- Electrical current turns on or off
    - On/off stage is a bit
- ***Binary Number System***
    - 2 digits: 0 and 1
    - Positions: 8s, 4s, 2s, 1s
        - 9 = 1001
    - More wires means larger numbers
- Text, images and sounds can be represented by numbers
- Text in Binary
    - Letters represent a number
- Text in images
    - Pixels -> colors -> numbers -> whole bunch of numbers
- Sound in Binary
    - Vibrations represented by waveform and anypoint can be represented by numbers
    - Higher bit = better sound quality
- Backbone of computers

# How Computers Work: Circuits & Logic

- Information (input) coming into the computer come together to create circuits and result in the output
- Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
- ***Not gonna lie, I got lost in the information the video was giving me.***

# How Computers Work: Memory, CPU, Input & Output

- Input
    - Converts physical input to binary information
        - Keyboards, mouse, video camera, microphone
- Memory
    - Stores information
        - RAM
- CPU
    - Central processing unit calculates information
- Output
    - Converts information to physical output
        - Information displayed on a computer, laptop, phone
- To display each letter a computer runs thousands of instructions
- Multiple CPUâ€™s help run code faster while multiple gigs or memory help store all the information

# How Computers Work: Hardware & Software

- Hardware
    - Circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, stuff
- Software
    - Computer programs or code running on the machine
    - Apps, games, websites, maps, creative, analysis
- CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
- The CPU receives simple command that tell it which circuit to use
- Code commands converts into hundreds or thousands binary commands that computer understands

## Operating system

### - **The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer**

### - ***Operating system manages software that controls the hardware, the software is a sequence of binary code that are circuits of electricity turning on and off***
