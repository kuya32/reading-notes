## Growth Mindset 
To me ***Growth Mindset*** means to be open-minded when learning something new and to continue to learn even when it gets difficult, boring, or for any other negative reason. To **continue to progress** even when the obstacle in front of you looks back-breaking. Some areas I feel I need to work on to develop a Growth Mindset is ***EMBRACE*** challenges and not stray away from them. Another one is to ***LEARN*** from criticism and not ignore or take it personally.

### Path Learning Vs. Sandbox Learning
Knowing the differences between these two different learning styles will help you progress through not only Code Fellows but **other areas of learning as well.**

### Skills for Sandbox Learning
1. Generating and selecting ideas 
     - What do you want to learn now
2. Planning your learning
     - Managing scope. Finding resources
3. Experimentation
     - Keeping track of what you've tried, what's worked and what hasn't
4. Reflection
     - Pausing every so often to tally what you've learned and what new questions you haver
5. **Finding help!**
